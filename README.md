# Cryptoanalysis-of-CMEA-and-RSA
This project includes cryptoanalysis of CMEA and low exponenet RSA algorithm using known plaintext attack and Chinese Remainder Theorem respectively. 

<h1> CMEA (Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm) </h1>
CMEA is a block cipher which operates on blocks of the size of 2 to 6 bytes. CMEA was one of the four cryptographic primitives
used in the mobile communications network in the US. The key length of CMEA is 64 bit.

There is a known-plaintext attack which recovers the key (and thusthe whole plaintext) given only 40 to 100 known plaintext blocks.


<h1> RSA </h1>
RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. 
In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. 
In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.
